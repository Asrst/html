We are excited to take your questions!</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c10">What is this AMA for?</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">General and technical questions about the PyTorch Scholarship program, your Challenge coursework, study and motivational tips!</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c10">What are AMA Guidelines:</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span>- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c10">VERY IMPORTANT</span><span>&nbsp;We will be using a </span><span class="c10">red light/green light</span><span>&nbsp;system for this AMA. If you see a green light, then that means we are taking new questions. &nbsp;If you see a red light, then we ask that you </span><span class="c10">not post any questions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as we need some time to answer previous students.</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span>- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AMAs are </span><span class="c10">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mandatory. These are optional sessions for students to attend.</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please help us keep this AMA organized by replying in thread!</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It will be impossible for us to answer everyone today, but don&#39;t worry, we are hosting 3 more sessions next week.

Please let everyone know that you are transcribing this session to avoid someone doing unnecessary work!</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0">- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are unable to attend an AMA session please know that you don&#39;t need to be present to reap the benefits! You can read any of our AMA transcripts that we&#39;ll post on the PyTorch Challenge site afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Also</span><span class="c0">....We&rsquo;ve been following the conversations on Slack and wanted to address 3 quick items before we get started:</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c15">What is Student Hub &amp; Knowledge?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Udacity students who are currently enrolled in a Nanodegree or have completed a Nanodegree, the Student Hub and Knowledge you see in your classroom are tied to other Nanodegrees you may be enrolled in. They are not part of the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c10">Explain me or Tell me about Slack Workspace</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Slack community is meant to be a launching pad for this community to meet and work together. We understand the it can be overwhelming, especially in the first week as everyone is joining and excited to connect and we hope that it will continue to be a space where you feel comfortable sharing good news, asking questions and getting help from your peers and the Alumni Volunteers. We will be rolling out initiatives like Student Leaders, Study Groups, Shout Outs and more in the upcoming weeks and it is through your engagement in these initiatives and the ones you create yourself and share with us that we can truly build a powerful community.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c10">What are the FAQs for this pytorch scholarship challenge?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you haven&rsquo;t read through the FAQs on our PyTorch Challenge Site yet, we encourage you to do so!

What are the other factors?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Udacity response:</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Combined question and answers)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Selection in the full Nanodegree program scholarship will be based on:</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Successful completion of the Challenge Course</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Level of participation and support of classmates in the student community</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All the selection criteria used in Phase 1</span></p><p class="c1 c13 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The course is considered fully completed by your completion of all the lessons, quizzes and the final challenge lab. There are no grades for completion.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the project, firstly, if you submitted the project at all. Then, if you passed. Then your overall score. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s completing the lessons and contributions to the community.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you have more questions about the above, you can check out the FAQs on the website:</span><span><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/faqs&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542350588001000">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c14"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/faqs&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542350588001000">https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/faqs</a></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.9key7g1tcdlr"><span class="c2">What would be on the criteria for selection for the 2nd phase of the challenge. Is our model score used to determine our selection? What are the other factors?</span></h3><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Student response:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was in a different cohort for another challenge scholarship, and those who moved on were those who were very consistent with participation and genuinely helped other students.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you work just a bit ahead and then help those with questions, you put yourself in good standing.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Udacity response:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At this time, we won&rsquo;t be sharing more details about how we will be measuring engagement. To add on to what @Matthew Knipfer said, we know that the students in this course will have a richer, more positive experience by learning from each other, sharing resources, and keeping each other motivated. For this reason, we encourage everyone to focus on where they can add and gain the most value. Make participation work for you- this is more likely to result in a better experience for you and for everyone else!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ud6kyr5113fn"><span class="c2">But does that mean that an incorrect response in one of the course exercises would significantly reduce one&#39;s chances?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no penalty for getting a quiz answer wrong, or spending longer on one portion of the coursework than another. As long as we see that you are attempting all quizzes and completing all of the content, we see that, and count it. So don&rsquo;t worry if you spend a little longer on some questions than others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Results on the classroom quizzes aren&rsquo;t considered as long as you complete all the lessons.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.qh1ewvb1040k"><span class="c2">For people who wants to compete for the Nano degree scholarship, how much contributions in slack is enough? And how do you measure if it&rsquo;s enough or not?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In terms of contributions in Slack, there is no minimum- we encourage you to focus on quality over quantity. Participation will look different for everyone, and we know students benefit the most when they aren&rsquo;t just participating to check a box, so find the way that you can both add and gain the most value in this community!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are really looking for quality over quantity! e.g. Providing technical support, motivation, contributing to useful conversation!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For that selection criteria, I say get involved as much as you can once we start rolling out the community programs.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ofuj7iyimp47"><span class="c20 c10">Can we complete the project early? I mean to say if I completed the project early the chances will be more or less?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can complete it early, but the timing isn&rsquo;t considered in who receives the scholarships.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will echo the wisdom of your fellow classmates. If you complete your coursework early, we hope you will use the time to help out your fellow classmates, arrange meetups, maybe even start a group project that showcases what you have learned. Think outside the box too! Maybe even host a learning webinar! We love anything that will help enrich and grow this student community!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ypsn8i8tepjm"><span class="c20 c10">How often may we submit our model of the final project?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As many times as you&rsquo;d like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&rsquo;t see the score and you can resubmit. We&rsquo;ll look at the highest overall score of your submissions.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.k75n3gv19uwj"><span class="c2">There was initiative to create a spreadsheet for the resources, but I guess people are worried that if they add it there it would not be a contribution. So what do you suggest? How to organize it?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a column in that doc where you can add your Slack name so that resource can be attributed to you!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.4og69i5qb66d"><span class="c2">How many people applied for phase 1?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I read 20,000 on the website.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>That&rsquo;s correct, we shared this on the PyTorch Challenge site in our welcome video:</span><span><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home?authuser%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542350588007000">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home?authuser%3D0&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542350588008000">https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home?authuser=0</a></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.utrfzhjp7q0k"><span class="c2">Hi, regarding the grading, is it the first score for a project that is counted, or the final score if you choose to resubmit?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The projects are pass/fail, and if you do not pass a project you have the option of redoing it. I recommend using the alumni mentors in this community to help you work through the projects if you have any questions!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.c093csubtpky"><span class="c2">Will be something like kaggle public scores for the 300 desired places?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We won&rsquo;t be sharing scores, just pass/fail.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ezsc69w7lgeo"><span class="c2">Selecting just 300 student out of 20 000ish isn&rsquo;t so brutally forcing people to be extremely competetive? Why didn&rsquo;t you make this selection ratio a little bit higher?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are actually 10,000 students in Phase 1 of the scholarship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Udacity as a company, and the Scholarships team in particular, exists to help as many people as possible access affordable technical education. While we&rsquo;re limited in how many full Nanodegree scholarships we can offer, we want as many people as possible to benefit from the PyTorch scholarship. Even for folks who don&rsquo;t move on to Phase 2, we hope that Phase 1 will be an awesome experience to learn new skills, build a professional network, get access to extra resources, and get one step closer to your individual educational and professional goals.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.8yc37tai2jyj"><span class="c2">So, how the community activity/participation or helping fellow students have an impact on the Phase 2 selection process?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Combination of questions and answers)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To address your 2nd questions, one of Udacity&#39;s mottos is #bettertogether. As we move through Challenge I promise you&#39;ll see the huge role that community plays in getting scholars to the finish line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Student response:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Consistent quality participation in the community. &nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to spam the chats, but pop in pretty often and help those struggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Udacity response:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a really valid question. We know from experience that teaching others is a great way of solidifying your learning; this is why we try to encourage as much interaction between all the scholarship participants as possible. One of Udacity&rsquo;s values is BetterTogether and this applies to our community of students as well as internally. Quality of engagement is much more important than quantity here. We&rsquo;ll be rolling out a lot of initiatives like our Student Leader Program, Study Groups and Shout Outs initiative that will provide ample opportunity for you to participate meaningfully. &nbsp;Help each other out - you&rsquo;ll go further together!</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.7mdrcc85btx4"><span class="c2">So, how the community activity/participation or helping fellow students have an impact on the Phase 2 selection process? Give an example How it happened in previous scholarship?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>Consistent quality participation in the community. &nbsp;That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to spam the chats, but pop in pretty often and help those struggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Student response:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hi! I&rsquo;m definitely not an expert and I don&rsquo;t know how the community involvement evaluation actually works, but I was a part of another Udacity scholarship challenge, and I can tell you that they aren&rsquo;t going to punish you for not spamming. I&rsquo;m a serious introvert, but I tried to participate whenever I had something that I thought might be helpful (like this) and I tried to hit emoticons pretty much every day and be supportive where I could, but otherwise I didn&rsquo;t have a ton to add. Even without a single spam post, I was selected to move on to the second part in that challenge! Just try to add what you can in whatever meaningful way you can: &nbsp;Udacity seems to have figured out a way to make it work</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.yfiuer42ux0h"><span class="c2">How to measure my performance related to other sscholars ? there are many of us which is great, but how could i know where I am located in the spectrum ?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We won&rsquo;t be sharing information about students&rsquo; progress relative to one another. I recommend not worrying about how others are doing compared to you, and just focus on your learning and staying actively engaged in the community! The most successful scholarship students are those who learn in community and dedicate regular time to their learning, so these should be your priorities.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.x9bbb5m5yz70"><span class="c2">To clarify , Slack is the only platform where our participation is being assessed right ?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll be sharing some additional ways to participte, like via in-person/virtual meetups, but Slack is the official hub for community in the scholarship.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ar94u4ysmku4"><span class="c2">When will admission to phase 2 be announced?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Phase 1 ends on January 9. Expect a break between the end of Phase 1 and Phase 2 announcements- it will be your chance to breathe a little! We will share more specifics closer to the end of Phase 1.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.2xq6qqil4s43"><span class="c2">As regards the group participation it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be public discussions right? Direct messages also count right?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will be sharing a lot of opportunities for to participate and engage in this program so please stay tuned for more to come in the #announcements. We are unable to monitor direct messages so we encourage you to participate in the public channels as well as in the initiate that we will be sharing more about in the upcoming weeks. For now, please make yourself comfortable in the community and get to know one another!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c3" id="h.uhjn5hr110t"><span class="c8">Category: Slack &amp; Other Communication</span></h2><h3 class="c5" id="h.h0vp7cm61o9p"><span class="c2">Timings of the sessions is really the one that we request to &nbsp;be considered</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Totally understand. We&#39;ll keep this in mind when scheduling future AMAs. In the meantime, know that you do not have to present to benefit from our AMAs and we&#39;ll have transcripts you can refer to afterwards!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.hsty0a79j4ix"><span class="c2">Is there a Udacity discussion forum for this course, beside Slack? If there is a discussion forum, I cannot view it from the iOS Udacity app. Is it only available on the site?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no discussion forum for this course- Slack is your go-to spot to interact with the community.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.hv2drm42muqw"><span class="c2">Do you guys have any admin continuously monitoring the Slack channels? As there are a lot of members and many of them are new, so each channel is being spammed by irrelevant content and useful information is getting harder to find, or even some genuine questions that we can reply to.</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keep in mind that this is the first day and students are really excited to be here! Things will calm down in a bit and especially more after Orientation on Monday when students start learning more about how things work. For those that are more accustomed to Slack, I ask for your patience and your help in getting everyone onboarded (in a friendly way, of course) &#x1f60a;</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.82rdkew7pge2"><span class="c2">Can we have some slack app like slark, or something , which could track all the messages , so we can keep a track of all the important resources , challenges and information discussed here?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We hope you understand that we want to keep the privacy of all students here and some apps could lead to a breach of that privacy. All of the important information you need to know - as well as the community programs - will be posted on the PyTorch Scholarship site.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1542350588015000">https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home</a></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For resources, while we have a Google doc I do encourage you or anyone interested to start something that you feel might work better!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.lmg1to59182s"><span class="c2">I think we need more specialized channels, i.e. country-wise like #USA, #france #india, and maybe one channel to find mates from other scholarships like the &ldquo;Grow with Google&rdquo;</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&rsquo;ll be sharing more information about how to request and add new channels in the coming weeks- keep an eye on #announcements for more info and thanks for your patience!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.194eyzhg5op7"><span class="c2">Can we have more channels regarding each specific topic?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll explain the process for requesting a Slack channel next week!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.oi0eyz6to4kc"><span class="c2">Twitch stream possible??

I know that no rule can change now, but in my opinion, I was wondering what if there were many different countries in the top 300, not a top 250 country, and the rest of the other countries. Why do I say this, because it would be ideal to give a chance to that nanodegree Deep Learning to many participants from different countries. This will lead to Deep Learning knowledge in many countries and not in a limited area of countries.</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t agree more &#x1f60a; In our previous international scholarships, we&rsquo;ve been thrilled to see that students from all over the world have excelled in Phase 1 and earned a spot in Phase 2!</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.bbza8p66dmjg"><span class="c2">I found a few mathematical imperfection in the slides.
